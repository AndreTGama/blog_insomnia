  ## Route to Permanently Destroy a User Account


  This route allows you to permanently destroy (delete) a user account in the system based on their ID. Unlike soft deletion, which can be restored, this action is irreversible.


  - **Route:** `/api/users/{id}`

  - **HTTP Method:** `DELETE`


  ### Parameter


  - `{id}` (required) - The unique ID of the user account you want to permanently destroy. 


  ## Workflow


  1. The client makes a DELETE request to `/api/users/{id}`, specifying the ID of the user account they want to permanently destroy as part of the URL.

  2. The controller calls the `destroy` function with the provided ID as a parameter.

  3. The controller uses `User::where('id', $id)->forceDelete()` to locate the user account with the specified ID and permanently destroy it, removing it from the database entirely.

  4. A successful response (status code 200) is returned to the client with a message indicating that the account has been permanently destroyed. The data payload is typically set to `null` as there is no user account data to return after destruction.

  5. If the user account is not found, the route may still return a successful response, indicating that the account does not exist.
